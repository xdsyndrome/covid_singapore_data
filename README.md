<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## About The Project
This is a simple for fun visualization exercise using Singapore's COVID-19 data.

### Built With
* [Python.Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Python.Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Python.Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Python.Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

### Things to Do Next? 
- [ ] Plot trend decomposition graph
- [ ] Forecast hospitalization numbers? (variance in COVID cases is too high for proper forecasting?)
